                    <p class="text-muted">As an individual with a positive attitude, good observation skills, and enthusiasm for learning, I understand the value of time management and clear communication. I’m great at working with teams to get projects done right.
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, my educational background of Bachelor’s in Public Health has strengthened my technical abilities and honed my data collection, review, analysis, presentation, and report writing skills. Importantly, my education has familiarized me with the workings of NGOs and their pertinence in initiating social change.  					                   
                  <br><br>
                        I am looking forward to gaining valuable experiences via organizational and community-based learning to enhance my administration abilities and work in different fields of public health to take action that is focused on preventing disease, promoting health, and prolonging life among the population as a whole; I optimistically aim to be an epidemiologist.</p>
